### **Introduction to GPCRs:**

In cellular communication, the interaction between a cell and its external environment begins with the binding of a ligand—an ion or molecule that serves as a first messenger—to a specific receptor on the cell. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), also known as Type 2 Metabotropic receptors, are a diverse group of cell surface receptors that mediate signal transduction by transmitting external signals, such as hormones or neurotransmitters, into the cell. Upon ligand binding, GPCRs activate intracellular G-proteins, triggering downstream signalling pathways \[1, 2]. This leads to the production of second messengers like cAMP, which activate calcium channels or protein kinases, resulting in the phosphorylation of target proteins and the cell's physiological response \[3].


### **Structure of GPCRs:**

GPCRs have seven transmembrane domains spanning the cell membrane with their ligand binding site located either on the extracellular surface or within the receptor. Unlike ion channels, they lack a pore and are composed of a single subunit. Upon ligand binding, GPCRs change shape and activate an associated G-protein—a guanosine nucleotide-binding protein composed of three subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma). This activation triggers a cascade of intracellular events, through the conversion of GTP to GDP by the G-protein \[1, 2]. 

**Role of GPCRs in Cancer Signaling:**

GPCRs are critical in cancer, influencing key hallmarks like cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of GPCR signalling, often due to mutations or overexpression, can lead to uncontrolled cell growth, survival, and metastasis. GPCRs also impact tumour interactions with their microenvironment, promoting angiogenesis, immune evasion, and cancer cell migration \[4]. 

Key pathways activated by GPCRs in cancer include the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, MAPK/ERK and Wnt/β-catenin pathways which are all involved in cell proliferation and differentiation \[4]. Specific subsets of GPCRs have also been linked to various cancers. For example, CXCR4 receptors are overexpressed in breast cancer and contribute to metastasis \[5]. S1P receptors also regulate cell migration and survival in various cancers, including lung and prostate cancer \[6].


### **GPCRs as Drug Targets:**

GPCRs are a major focus in drug development, with 30-40% of approved drugs targeting these receptors or related proteins due to their wide-ranging physiological functions and easy accessibility on the cell surface \[7]. GPCR activity can be modulated by drugs that either compete with the natural ligand at the orthosteric site, requiring higher affinity and concentration, or by using allosteric modulators, which bind to distinct sites. Allosteric modulators offer greater selectivity and allow the natural ligand to still bind to the orthosteric site \[8, 9].

Drugs targeting GPCRs can take many forms, from small molecules (which are easier to develop and administer) to monoclonal antibodies (which offer high specificity). Examples include endothelin receptor antagonists for ovarian and prostate cancer \[10], and Smoothened inhibitors like Vismodegib for basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma \[11]. Additionally, CXCR4 antagonists like Plerixafor are being explored to disrupt the tumour microenvironment and enhance immunotherapy by inhibiting cancer cell metastasis \[12, 13].


### **Conclusion**

GPCRs are central to cancer biology, contributing to tumour initiation, progression, and metastasis through aberrant signalling pathways. Their importance as drug targets lies in their accessibility, involvement in key signalling cascades, and potential for modulating cancer cells, the tumour microenvironment, and immune response. This makes them attractive candidates for developing novel cancer therapies.
